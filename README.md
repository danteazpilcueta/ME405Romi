IMU Driver Commands and Documentation:

This command is used to initialize the IMU object. It requires an I2C object to be created and configured outside of the driver. The configured driver and the hardware address of the device must be passed through for initilization

This command changes the opperating mode. It takes a string as its input. If the string is within the list ['IMU', 'imu', 'Compass', 'compass', 'COMPASS','M4G', 'NDOF_FMC_OFF', 'NDOF','ONLYGYR'] then it switches the imu to the relevant mode

This requires no arguement and simply returns the current x y and z signed angular velocities as a 3 value list

This requires no arguement and simply returns the current x y and z signed accelerations as a 3 value list

This requires no arguement and simply returns the current x y and z signed magnetic field readings as a 3 value list

This requires no arguement and simply returns the current x y and z signed euler angle readings as a 3 value list

This requires no arguement and simply returns the current 4 calibration status bits. when all 4 bits are 3, the device is calibrated

This requires no arguement and simply returns the 22 calibration constants as a list

Calibrates the romi directly from a file. Must have a file on the device named calibs.txt which must contain a list of the values in order



Robot Runnings: 
Both motors are set by default to their max speed. Rather then increase speed when needed, we decrease speed instead. 
When one sensor starts to see black that means that that side of the robot is begining to cross the line. To fix this, the motor on that side slows down inducing a turn.  
This also means that for short gaps the robot continues straight at full speed. The short gap is not enough time for any significant drift to occur so it continues right on course after hitting the line again. 
For the branch segments, both motors see black at the same time and slow the same amount meaning there is no turn induced and the robot continues straight.
